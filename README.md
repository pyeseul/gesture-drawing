# gesture-drawing

A gesture drawing tool that allows you to make a 10x10 pixel art using gestures that a gesture sensor can detect (up, down, left, right, far/close). This tool was developed to offer children an opportunity to explore a new type of interaction with computers and learn about the concept of pixels. 

## Hardware

Gesture Drawing requires an Arduino model and a gesture sensor. 
This library has been tested with the following models:

- [SparkFun RGB and Gesture Sensor - APDS-9960](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/apds-9960-rgb-and-gesture-sensor-hookup-guide)
- [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno)

## Notes

The work was presented at [BRIC](http://www.bricartsmedia.org/) Open House 2016 with the description below.

"Abra-Cadabra":
What if you could be a wizard and control your surroundings by just a flick of your wrist? Come play with a gesture sensor and explore a way of using motion as a way to interact with technology.
