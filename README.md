# gesture-drawing

This software provides a canvas for the user to paint their own pixel art by using simple hand motions which are detected by a gesture sensor. This software can be used as a teaching aid for introducing children to the possibilties of gestural interaction as well as a reference point for programmers looking to create gesture-based drawing software.

## Instruction for drawing

- UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: move the cursor one cell to the direction
- Push your hand towards the sensor: change color of the cell (blue -> red -> yellow -> delete) everytime the sensor detects the movement

## Hardware

Gesture Drawing requires an Arduino model and a gesture sensor. 
This library has been tested with the following models:

- [SparkFun RGB and Gesture Sensor - APDS-9960](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/apds-9960-rgb-and-gesture-sensor-hookup-guide)
- [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno)

## Notes

The work was presented at [BRIC](http://www.bricartsmedia.org/) Open House 2016 with the description below.

"Abra-Cadabra":
What if you could be a wizard and control your surroundings by just a flick of your wrist? Come play with a gesture sensor and explore a way of using motion as a way to interact with technology.
